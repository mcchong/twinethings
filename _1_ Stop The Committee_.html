Our goal is to piece together a sentence that has been hidden in the archival material here. We have directions, but we need to break the cipher to properly understand them. This is what I’m looking at in my copy of the Master Plan:

1. WITHIN

3. POINT
4. R-S/WWWE-S, Jewkttdkm
5. U-EEE/WEEE-E, Rerkttdkm

&lt;td&gt;Q&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;V&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;W&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;X&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Z&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
}

So if I write my name (Blood) in this cipher it’d be OBFFL (B=O, L=B, O=F etc.)

[[With me so far?|fc-code-1]] </tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="fc-code-1" tags="" position="302,1604">I guess I should explain what you&#39;re looking at, using the first direction code, P - EEE/SEEE - E,Rerkm. 

The first letter is the file. You&#39;ll see that they are all marked with a letter. For number 1 on that list &#39;P&#39; would be folder &#39;A&#39;.

The next part, after the dash, looks like a date in Roman numerals, so that will be the article we want. So EEE/SEEE would be III/VIII which would probably be March 8th.

After that is looks like an other numeral, this time, &quot;one&quot;. That means the first paragraph. 

Finally the word in that paragraph. In this case Rerkm is &quot;fifth&quot;. 

So the first word is in file A, in an article dated March 8th, in paragraph one. Then count over to the fifth word.

&quot;within TWO point FIVE BARRACKS&quot;

Not entirely sure what that means, but I suspect it&#39;ll be clearer with the other clues.

Do you know where the old barracks are? I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a mention in those files somewhere...

Here&#39;s an old picture of the barracks, or at least part of it. The shed-looking thing behind the children is the barracks, and those buildings look like the row-houses on the corner of Courtland and Queen. 

&lt;img src=&quot;assets/barracks.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt;

Isn&#39;t that the housing co-op building?
