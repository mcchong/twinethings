Our goal here is to piece together a sentence that has been hidden through the archival material here. We have directions, but we need to break the ciphered to properly understand them. This is what I’m looking at in my copy of the Master Plan:

[code]

Each series of letters corresponds to a file in the cabinet, then to an article within that file, then a paragraph within the article, and finally a specific word within the paragraph.

We could just guess, based on statistics, but I know how to find the Key to the cipher. Please don’t ask how. Let’s just say there’s a reason the mayor is bald… 

Does this make [[sense to you|found-fc-2]]? Or not?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="28" name="found-fc-2" tags="" position="504,1099">The Key word we need to break the cipher is hidden in a file labelled (bizarrely) “H.B.S. - Weekly Poultry Column.” Find the article labelled ‘Magister’

Have you [[found it|found-fc-3]]?</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="29" name="found-fc-3" tags="" position="303,1099">Ok, now read up to the first time this “H.B.S.” says the word ‘chicken’ and count backwards seven words. The seventh word is the Key word, and the one we need. 

What word did you get? [it should be: ‘poultrymen’]

[[Got it?|found-fc-4]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="30" name="found-fc-4" tags="" position="303,1308">Sure. Sounds about absurd enough for Co99. If you want to break the cipher yourself write out the alphabet on a line, then directly below it write ‘pountrymen’ and fill in the rest of the alphabet without repeating letters. Let me know when you’re done breaking the cipher. 

Unless you just want me to do it… I’ve gotten pretty good at [[these things|found-fc-5]].</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="31" name="found-fc-5" tags="" position="303,1458">This is what I got. Look ok?

So if I write my name in this cipher it’d be OBFFL (B=O, L=B, B=D etc.)

Which means the directions should look like this:

[[Got it|found-fc-6]]</tw-passagedata>
<tw-passagedata pid="32" name="found-fc-6" tags="" position="303,1608">I guess I should explain what that means. The first letter is the file. The backslash denotes an additional direction, so the next one looks like a date in Roman numerals, so that will be the article we want. After that is another letter… hmm… I going to guess here, and say it’s probably alpha-numeric, so for the first one, ‘[letter]’ that would mean paragraph ‘[number]’. Finally the word in that paragraph. So the first direction is in file [letter], in an article dated [month/day], in paragraph ‘[letter]’ which we know is the [numberth] paragraph, and the [numberth] word. 

What does that give you?
[ word ] </tw-passagedata>
